GitZilla
========

GitZilla is Python magic to support Git-Bugzilla integration. There are
various ways of using GitZilla.

Note that GitZilla must be installed on the machine receiving commits from
everyone - home to the the "official" or the "central" repository.


Usage
.....

Simple ready scripts
--------------------

To quickly start using GitZilla:

  * Install GitZilla. You may choose the .deb for easy installation on
    Debian/Ubuntu systems. Otherwise, just unpack the source and install in
    the usual setuptools way::

        sudo python setup.py install

  * Switch to the hooks directory (/path/to/repository/.git/hooks) and delete
    the 'post-receive' and 'update' hooks.

  * Link (or copy) the gitzilla provided hooks::

        ln -s $(which gitzilla-post-receive) post-receive
        ln -s $(which gitzilla-update) update

  * Read and edit the config file at /etc/gitzillarc

  * Commit away!


Custom GitZilla
---------------

If you need the hooks to do other stuff apart from just the Bugzilla
integration, you could write your hook as a Python script and leave the
Bugzilla stuff to one of the functions from 'gitzilla.hooks'.

In fact with the defaults, the ready scripts are equivalent to the following:

post-receive::

    #!/usr/bin/python
    from gitzilla.hooks import post_receive
    post_receive("https://repo.example.com/bugzilla", "username", "password")


update::

    #!/usr/bin/python
    from gitzilla.hooks import update
    update()

The provided ready scripts do more, but that's just parsing and picking up
values from the configuration files.

You could pass a custom bug id extraction regex and your own logging.Logger
instance. The update hook function also accepts an array of allowed bug status
strings. If that is provided, bugzilla credentials MUST be provided as well.

Look at the module help for gitzilla.hooks for more information.


Down and dirty
--------------

This is an internal-only mode for now. More info when this is stable.


Requirements
............

To install and run GitZilla, you need:

  - Python (tested with 2.6.4, should work with >=2.5)
  - pybugz (tested with 0.8.0)

Of course, to make it useful you also need a Bugzilla installation somewhere
(not required to be on the same machine). GitZilla has been tested with
Bugzilla 3.0.11 and should work with any Bugzilla version supported by pybugz.

The excellent pybugz can be obtained from http://github.com/ColdWind/pybugz/
and http://github.com/ColdWind/pybugz/downloads/


Download
........

GitZilla is hosted at GitHub : http://github.com/gera/gitzilla

You can access the downloads at : http://github.com/gera/gitzilla/downloads

The download page contains a .deb which should work on Debian and Ubuntu
systems.
